Assessment Unit 1</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this assessment, you are required to develop a partial compiler for
the language <strong>PAL</strong> (Pretty Awful Language).
You will only be building the <strong>frontend</strong> of the compiler: you need to
implement parsing and semantic analysis, but you don't need to implement
artifact generation.</p>
<p>Please read through the whole of this document carefully before starting
work, including the <strong>Submission</strong> and <strong>Grading Criteria</strong> sections.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please contact me
(<strong>a.sampson@abertay.ac.uk</strong>).</p>
<h2>Software Requirements</h2>
<p>The overall objective of this assignment is to develop a parser and
semantic analyser for the language <strong>PAL</strong>, encapsulated within a
command-line application that will enable a user to process a PAL
program to verify its <strong>syntactic</strong> and <strong>semantic</strong> correctness.</p>
<p>Your primary source document for this is
<a href="PAL.EBNF.txt">the EBNF specification of PAL</a>,
which includes commentary on the semantics of the language.</p>
<p>I will run your compiler application inside an automated test harness
as part of the marking process, so you need to keep the compiler's
interface very simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your compiler application must take the name of the PAL program file
  as its only command-line argument (i.e. in C#, the first element of
  the array of arguments passed to <code>Main</code>).</li>
<li>Error messages should be printed to standard output, with the compiler
  <strong>printing absolutely nothing</strong> if the PAL program is correct.</li>
<li>The compiler must not expect any user input other than the
  command-line arguments, or display a GUI.</li>
</ul>
<p>I strongly suggest that you use C# and the Ardkit framework &mdash;
which we used in previous practicals &mdash; to implement your compiler.
If you'd like to use a different language or framework, I'm happy for
you to do so, but you <strong>must</strong> contact me by email to confirm that it'll
meet the assessment requirements before starting work.</p>
<p>I've provided a pre-written scanner for PAL for you to use as the basis
for your compiler; see the
PALScanner source file (PALScanner.cs) and (for reference)
the FSM that it implements (PAL.FSM.txt).
This source file is complete; please don't modify it in any way.</p>
<h2>Suggested Activities</h2>
<p>Following is a methodology that you can follow in developing your
compiler.
This process will enable you to build up your application step by step,
testing each stage as it is completed so that you know the next step is
being built on a sound foundation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Review the EBNF specification for PAL (PAL.EBNF.txt), noting the
   different forms that the declarations and statements can take.</li>
<li>Write some programs in the language, to check your understanding
   of the syntax and to act as test programs for the compiler as it is
   developed.</li>
<li>Download the C# scanner file that has been provided.</li>
<li>Ensure you know how to use the Ardkit framework classes by referring
   back to previous lectures, practicals and examples; ask if you are in
   doubt.</li>
<li>Develop a "pure" recursive-descent parser for PAL.  This will be
   defined as a class inheriting from the <code>RecoveringRdParser</code> class in
   the Ardkit compiler toolkit library.</li>
<li>Write the main application that will instantiate the parser and
   provide an appropriate command-line interface.</li>
<li>Test your "pure" parser by running your application against a suite
   of test programs.
   Your testing should ensure that valid programs are verified as such,
   and that <strong>syntactically invalid</strong> programs have their errors
   reported correctly.</li>
<li>Add semantic analysis to the parser.
   This will involve developing a semantic analysis class and symbol
   table mechanism, based around the Ardkit compiler toolkit framework.
   Ardkit includes a range of error classes that should be sufficient
   for most projects; you can also add new error classes if you feel you
   need them.</li>
<li>Test that semantic analysis works correctly by again running your
   application against your test suite.
   This should include valid programs and programs that are
   syntactically valid but <strong>semantically invalid</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should now have a complete and correct parser and semantic analyser
for the PAL language.</p>
<h2>Test suite</h2>
<p>As described above, you need to come up with a suite of PAL test
programs to ensure that your program handles both valid and invalid
programs correctly.
Please refer back to advice in previous modules about how to design test
suites &mdash; for example, thinking about coverage of the specification
and/or your compiler code, and about testing unusual cases in the code.</p>
<p>I encourage you to exchange test programs with other students.
Since you're all implementing the same language specification, this is a
good way of finding problems in your implementation that you might
otherwise not have thought of.
It's all right to include test programs that came from other students
along with your own tests in the submission, but these must be clearly
distinguished from your own work (e.g.&nbsp;by putting them in a
different folder) &mdash; and you shouldn't be relying entirely on other
students' tests!</p>
<h2>Submission</h2>
<p>For Unit 1, you must submit a ZIP file containing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The complete source code for your compiler.</li>
<li>The compiled <code>.exe</code> of your PAL compiler, that I can run against my
  own test suite of sample PAL programs.</li>
<li>Your test suite of valid and invalid PAL programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your ZIP file must be submitted through MyLearningSpace
by <strong>23:59 on Tuesday 11th May</strong>,</p>
<p>Feedback will be available on Tuesday 1st June (15 working days after
submission).</p>
<h2>Grading Criteria</h2>
<p>Unit 1 will be assessed using the following criteria;</p>
<ul>
<li>the correctness and completeness of your application when executed
  against my test suite of valid and invalid PAL programs, and</li>
<li>the quality of your code and test suite.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>maximum</strong> grade that can be achieved depends on the extent to
which you have completed the compiler implementation in terms of both
parsing and semantic analysis.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="center">Maximum Grade</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center">A</td>
<td>The application fully and correctly implements parsing and semantic analysis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">B</td>
<td>Parsing and semantic analysis are fully implemented but with some minor errors in either or both.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">C</td>
<td>Parsing is implemented (perhaps with some minor errors) but semantic analysis has major omissions or errors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">D</td>
<td>Parsing is implemented (perhaps with some major omissions or errors) but with little or no semantic analysis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">MF</td>
<td>The submission could meet the minimum D standard with some more work under minimal direction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">F</td>
<td>Substantial work and direction would be required to bring the submission up to the minimum D standard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">NS</td>
<td>No submission, or the submission contained no relevant material.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The above maximum grades will be awarded if the quality of the code and
test suite reflects the good practice taught in previous modules &mdash;
in particular, your code and tests should be written so that they are
easy to read, following consistent naming and formatting conventions,
and could be maintained by a future developer.
Grades below the maximum will be awarded for code that does not follow
good development practice.</p></body>
